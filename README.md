# yf-config-files

The repository contains some configuration files I used for study and work. The initial aim of this repo is to store my vim .vimrc file, but I would like to share more configuration files.

Put the `.vimrc` file in `~/.vimrc`, for the color scheme, I use molokai: https://github.com/tomasr/molokai, the `molokai.vim` should be resided in `~/.vim/colors`

For tmux configuration, put `.tmux.conf` in `~/.tmux.conf`

For zsh config, put `.zshrc` in `~/.zshrc`
